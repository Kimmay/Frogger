Hello! Welcome to Frogger!

In this game, you want to get your character to the water before being overrun by bugs. Use the arrow keys to guide your character around the screen, 
but be careful! If you touch a bug, you will lose a life point. Once your life points reach zero, the game will end. Also watch out for rocks that 
block your path! You'll have to navigate around them while keeping away from all the bugs in order to win the game. The scoreboard on the bottom keeps 
track of how many wins you currently have.
